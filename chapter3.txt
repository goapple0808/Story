So I wander on the street to think whether there is some ways to fix my problem.
When I was crossing the road on the zebra line. A giant truck just out of control and struck me intensively.
and I just loss my conscious. After I woke up again. I found myself lie in the middle of a little town and the people's wearings
are so strange.
